# MCP-Demo
This repository contains the code to build a simple **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) server using **LangChain**, **LangGraph** and the **Azure OpenAI API**.

### Features
- A **Math Server** that performs the basic arithmetic operations.
- A **Weather Check Function**, which currently returns a hard-coded value ( no actual API integration is implemented).

### Usage Instructions
1. Run both the **math server** and the **weather function server** in seperate terminals.
2. Use the command prompt to execute the **client file**, which communicates with both components.
